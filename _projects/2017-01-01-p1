This Discord bot automates more than 90% of Pok√©mon draft league operations, significantly increasing the efficiency of draft leagues and reducing the workload of organizers. It also contains a recovery system to handle crashes and updates. While the recovery system required some data to be saved to the disk, I optimized the speed of commands by prioritizing in-memory operations. The bot is currently used by 3 draft leagues in a Discord server with over 100 members.
