As someone who participated in Pok√©mon draft leagues, I noticed that many processes require the constant presence of draft hosts (organizers). Since this is often not possible, frequent delays occur. I created this Discord bot, which automates more than 90% of draft league operations, to address the problem. In addition to its core functionalities, the bot also contains a recovery system to handle data loss from crashes and updates. While the recovery system required some disk operations, I optimized the speed of commands by prioritizing in-memory operations whenever possible. The bot is currently used by 3 draft leagues in a Discord server with over 100 members. It significantly increased the efficiency of the draft leagues and reduced the workload of hosters.
