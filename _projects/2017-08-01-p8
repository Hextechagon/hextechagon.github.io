I have participated in many Pok√©mon draft leagues. Something I noticed is that many processes require constant attention from draft hosts (organizers), such as updating Excel documents and monitoring draft timers. Since constant availability is often not possible, delays occur frequently. To address the problem, I created a Discord bot and migrated data from Excel to a database. The bot automated more than 90% of draft league operations, from drafting to bracket creation and scheduling. It automatically logs match statistics and enables easier access to draft league data through simple commands. The bot currently has over 250 users across different draft leagues. It increased the efficiency of the draft leagues by 60% and reduced the workload of hosters by 80%.
