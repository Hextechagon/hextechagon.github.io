For this project, my group implemented a thread Library to manage the creation, lifetime, and execution of various thread bodies on a multi-core system. It contains advanced functionalities such as mutexes, conditional variables, generic threads, inner process interrupt capabilities, and thread lifetime management operations (yield and join). This project is in a private repository since it's a course project, but it is available upon request.
