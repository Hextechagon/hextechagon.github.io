For this project, I implemented a thread Library to manage the creation, lifetime, and execution of various thread bodies on a multi-core system. It contains advanced functionalities such as mutexes, conditional variables, generic threads, inner process interrupt capabilities, and thread lifetime management operations (yield and join).
