This project is a scalable search engine similar to Google or Bing. It creates a segmented inverted index of web pages using a pipeline of MapReduce programs executed using Hadoop. REST API index servers are built to return JSON formatted hits and the corresponding scores, calculated using a combination of
tf-idf text analysis and PageRank link analysis. Finally, a search server with a user interface returns top search results using server-side dynamic pages, making REST API requests to each index server in parallel threads. This project is in a private repository since it's from a course, please email me if you wish to view it.
