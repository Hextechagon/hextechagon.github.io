For this project, I constructed a scalable search engine similar to Google or Bing. We created a segmented inverted index of web pages using a pipeline of MapReduce programs executed with Hadoop. REST API index servers were built to return JSON formatted hits and the corresponding scores, calculated using a combination of
tf-idf text analysis and PageRank link analysis. Finally, a search server with a scalable user interface returns top search results using server-side dynamic pages, making REST API requests to each index server in parallel threads.
