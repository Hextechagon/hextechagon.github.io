title:  "Sharded Key-Value Server | Go"

I built a sharded fault-tolerant key-value database with a set of replica groups and a configuration service (shard master). Each replica group consists of a handful of servers that use Paxos to replicate the shards assigned to the group. The shard master also uses Paxos for replication, and it manages shard assignment to replica groups as well as shard lookups. Additionally, it can change the assignment of keys to shards in response to changing load. The database can perform Put/Get operations in parallel on different shards, enabling it to support applications that put a high load on the system.
