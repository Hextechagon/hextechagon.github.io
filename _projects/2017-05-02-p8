I constructed a scalable search engine similar to Google or Bing. First, I created a segmented inverted index of web pages using a pipeline of MapReduce programs executed with Hadoop. I then built 3 REST API index servers to return ranked search results in JSON format, calculated using a weighted combination of tf-idf text analysis and PageRank link analysis. Finally, I created a search server with a user interface that returns top search results by making API requests to index servers in parallel threads and combining them.
