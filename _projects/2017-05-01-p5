This project used Primâ€™s algorithm to minimize the distance of the path that a zookeeper has to take to traverse every cage to feed the animals in a zoo. It
solved the traveling salesman problem for the underground water canal system beneath the cages efficiently using branch and bound. This project is in a private repository since it's from a course, please email me if you wish to view it.
