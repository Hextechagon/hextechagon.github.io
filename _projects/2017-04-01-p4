title:  "Virtual Memory Manager | C++"

For this project, I created a virtual memory manager that supports swap-backed and file-backed pages. The pager interface maintains processes' address spaces, enabling syscalls, forking of child processes with a non-empty virtual arena, creation of customizable memory sizes with a clock queue that controls eviction ordering, and control of enable bits to dictate read and write permissions as well as the residency of a given physical page.
