In this project, my group created an Instagram clone. The feed was implemented using client-side dynamic pages, where a client application written in React runs in the web browser and makes AJAX calls to a REST API made with Flask. All the other pages were implemented using server-side dynamic pages, rendering Jinja2 templates on-demand when a user loads a page. The passwords stored in the database uses hashing to protect against database leaks and salting to protect against rainbow table attacks. We also successfully deployed this project to AWS for a short duration. This project is in a private repository since it's from a course; please email me if you wish to view it.
