For this project, my group created an Instagram clone. The feed was implemented using client-side dynamic pages, where a client application written in React runs in the web browser and makes AJAX calls to a REST API made with Flask. All the other pages were implemented using server-side dynamic pages, rendering Jinja2 templates on-demand when a user loads a page. The passwords stored in the database use hashing to protect against database leaks and salting to protect against rainbow table attacks. We also successfully deployed this project to AWS after completion. This project is in a private repository since it's a course project, but it is available upon request.
