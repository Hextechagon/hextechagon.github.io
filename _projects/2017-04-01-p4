I built a thread library to manage the creation, lifetime, and execution of concurrent threads on a multi-core system. It provides threads (including yield and join operations), mutexes, conditional variables, and inter-processor interrupts. The library enforces FIFO scheduling order for all thread operations, including the ready queue, mutex wait queue, condition variable wait queue, and thread join queue.
