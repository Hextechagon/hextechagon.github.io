title:  "Virtual Memory Manager | C++"
layout: post
---

For this project, my group created a virtual memory manager that supports swap-backed and file-backed pages. The pager interface maintains processes' address spaces, enabling syscalls, forking of child processes with a non-empty virtual arena, creating customizable memory sizes with a clock queue that controls eviction ordering, and controlling enable bits to dictate read and write permissions as well as the residency of a given physical page. This project is in a private repository since it's a course project, but it is available upon request.
