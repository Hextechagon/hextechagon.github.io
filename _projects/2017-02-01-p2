This project is a two-player game of Xiangqi, where the board is rotated every turn to provide each player with a smooth first person experience
using only one screen. The user interface is clean and robust, higlighting all possible moves for each selected piece as well as checkmates. It also
has a replay system that enables players to review their matches, complete with forward and backward navigation.
