My family and I enjoy the game of Xiangqi greatly, playing together whenever we have spare time on our hands. Drawing inspiration from our common interest, I created this two-player Xiangqi game. The board is rotated every turn to provide each player with a smooth, first person experience using only one screen.
The user interface appears clean and robust, higlighting and color-coding all possible moves for each selected piece as well as checkmates. It also has a replay system that enables players to review their matches, complete with forward and backward navigation. I am planning on adding more features to the game, such as keeping track of records between players.
