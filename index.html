  <p1>I am a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I have a passion for building software that has a meaningful impact. I am particularly interested in backend development and have experience with it using C++, Python, and SQL, among other languages. In my spare time, I like to keep up with the latest technological trends. You can also catch me watching sports, playing table tennis, and exploring nature.
