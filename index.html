  <p1>I am a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I have a passion for building software that has a meaningful impact. I am particularly interested in backend development and have experience with it using C++, Python, and SQL, among other languages. In my spare time, I like to keep up with the latest technological trends. You can also catch me watching sports, playing table tennis, and exploring nature. This website only contains my project portfolio for now, but I will expand upon it in the future.
